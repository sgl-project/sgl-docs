## 1. Model Introduction

[Qwen3 series](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3) are the most powerful vision-language models in the Qwen series to date, featuring advanced capabilities in multi-modal understanding, reasoning, and agentic applications.

This generation delivers comprehensive upgrades across the board:

- **Stronger general intelligence**: Significant improvements in instruction following, logical reasoning, text comprehension, mathematics, science, coding, and tool usage.
- **Broader multilingual knowledge**: Substantial gains in long-tail knowledge coverage across multiple languages.
- **More helpful & aligned responses**: Markedly better alignment with user preferences in subjective and open-ended tasks, enabling higher-quality, more useful text generation.
- **Extended context length**: Enhanced capabilities in understanding and reasoning over 256K-token long contexts.
- **Stronger agent interaction capabilities**: Improved tool use and search-based agent performance.
- **Flexible deployment options**: Available in Dense and MoE architectures that scale from edge to cloud, with Instruct and reasoning-enhanced Thinking editions.

For more details, please refer to the [official Qwen3 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3).

## 2. SGLang Installation

SGLang offers multiple installation methods. You can choose the most suitable installation method based on your hardware platform and requirements.

Please refer to the [official SGLang installation guide](https://docs.sglang.ai/get_started/install.html) for installation instructions.

## 3. Model Deployment

This section provides deployment configurations optimized for different hardware platforms and use cases.

### 3.1 Basic Configuration

The Qwen3 series offers models in various sizes and architectures, optimized for different hardware platforms including NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The recommended launch configurations vary by hardware and model size.

**Interactive Command Generator**: Use the configuration selector below to automatically generate the appropriate deployment command for your hardware platform, model size, quantization method, and thinking capabilities.

import { Qwen3Deployment } from "/src/snippets/autoregressive/qwen3-deployment.jsx";

<Qwen3Deployment />

### 3.2 Configuration Tips

- **Memory Management** : Set lower `--context-length` to conserve memory. A value of `128000` is sufficient for most scenarios, down from the default 262K.
- **Expert Parallelism** : SGLang supports Expert Parallelism (EP) via `--ep`, allowing experts in MoE models to be deployed on separate GPUs for better throughput. One thing to note is that, for quantized models, you need to set `--ep` to a value that satisfies the requirement: `(moe_intermediate_size / moe_tp_size) % weight_block_size_n == 0, where moe_tp_size is equal to tp_size divided by ep_size.` Note that EP may perform worse in low concurrency scenarios due to additional communication overhead. Check out [Expert Parallelism Deployment](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docs/advanced_features/expert_parallelism.md) for more details.
- **Kernel Tuning** : For MoE Triton kernel tuning on your specific hardware, refer to [fused_moe_triton](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/benchmark/kernels/fused_moe_triton).
- **Speculative Decoding**: Using Speculative Decoding for latency-sensitive scenarios.
  - `--speculative-algorithm EAGLE3`: Speculative decoding algorithm
  - `--speculative-num-steps 3`: Number of speculative verification rounds
  - `--speculative-eagle-topk 1`: Top-k sampling for draft tokens
  - `--speculative-num-draft-tokens 4`: Number of draft tokens per step
  - `--speculative-draft-model-path`: The path of the draft model weights. This can be a local folder or a Hugging Face repo ID such as [`lmsys/SGLang-EAGLE3-Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-SpecForge-Meituan`](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/SGLang-EAGLE3-Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-SpecForge-Meituan).

## 4. Model Invocation

### 4.1 Basic Usage

For basic API usage and request examples, please refer to:

- [SGLang Basic Usage Guide](https://docs.sglang.ai/basic_usage/send_request.html)
- [SGLang OpenAI Vision API Guide](https://docs.sglang.ai/basic_usage/openai_api_vision.html)

### 4.2 Advanced Usage

#### 4.2.1 Reasoning Parser

Qwen3-235B-A22B supports reasoning mode. Enable the reasoning parser during deployment to separate the thinking and content sections:

```shell
python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 \
  --reasoning-parser qwen3 \
  --tp 8 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8000
```

**Streaming with Thinking Process:**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",
    api_key="EMPTY"
)

# Enable streaming to see the thinking process in real-time
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Solve this problem step by step: What is 15% of 240?"}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=2048,
    stream=True
)

# Process the stream
has_thinking = False
has_answer = False
thinking_started = False

for chunk in response:
    if chunk.choices and len(chunk.choices) > 0:
        delta = chunk.choices[0].delta

        # Print thinking process
        if hasattr(delta, 'reasoning_content') and delta.reasoning_content:
            if not thinking_started:
                print("=============== Thinking =================", flush=True)
                thinking_started = True
            has_thinking = True
            print(delta.reasoning_content, end="", flush=True)

        # Print answer content
        if delta.content:
            # Close thinking section and add content header
            if has_thinking and not has_answer:
                print("\n=============== Content =================", flush=True)
                has_answer = True
            print(delta.content, end="", flush=True)

print()
```

**Output Example:**

```
=============== Thinking =================

Okay, so I need to figure out what 15% of 240 is. Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I remember some basics. Let me start by recalling that "percent" means "per hundred," so 15% is the same as 15 per 100, or 15/100. So, maybe I can convert 15% into a decimal first? Yeah, I think that's a common method.
...
So conclusion: The answer is 36.

=============== Content =================


To determine what 15% of 240 is, we can follow a systematic approach that involves converting the percentage to a decimal and then performing multiplication. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

....

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{36}
$$

Thus, 15% of 240 is **36**.
```

**Note:** The reasoning parser captures the model's step-by-step thinking process, allowing you to see how the model arrives at its conclusions.

#### 4.2.3 Tool Calling

Qwen3 supports tool calling capabilities. Enable the tool call parser:

```shell
python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 \
  --reasoning-parser qwen3 \
  --tool-call-parser qwen25 \
  --tp 8 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8000
```

**Python Example (with Thinking Process):**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",
    api_key="EMPTY"
)

# Define available tools

                "required": ["location"]
            }
        }
    }
]

# Make request with streaming to see thinking process
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Beijing?"}
    ],
    tools=tools,

        delta = chunk.choices[0].delta

        # Print thinking process
        if hasattr(delta, 'reasoning_content') and delta.reasoning_content:
            if not thinking_started:
                print("=============== Thinking =================", flush=True)
                thinking_started = True
            has_thinking = True
            print(delta.reasoning_content, end="", flush=True)

        # Accumulate tool calls
        if hasattr(delta, 'tool_calls') and delta.tool_calls:
            # Close thinking section if needed
            if has_thinking and thinking_started:

                        'arguments': ''
                    }

                        tool_calls_accumulator[index]['name'] = tool_call.function.name
                    if tool_call.function.arguments:
                        tool_calls_accumulator[index]['arguments'] += tool_call.function.arguments

        # Print content
        if delta.content:
            print(delta.content, end="", flush=True)

# Print accumulated tool calls
for index, tool_call in sorted(tool_calls_accumulator.items()):
    print(f"🔧 Tool Call: {tool_call['name']}")
    print(f"   Arguments: {tool_call['arguments']}")

print()
```

**Output Example:**

```
=============== Thinking =================

Okay, the user is asking for the weather in Beijing. Let me check the tools available. There's a function called get_weather that takes location and unit parameters. The location is required, so I need to specify Beijing as the location. The unit is optional and can be either celsius or fahrenheit. Since the user didn't specify the unit, maybe I should default to a common one. In China, they usually use celsius, so I'll set unit to celsius. I'll call the get_weather function with location: Beijing and unit: celsius. That should get the current weather for them.



=============== Content =================

🔧 Tool Call: get_weather
   Arguments: {"location": "Beijing", "unit": "celsius"}
```

**Note:**

- The reasoning parser shows how the model decides to use a tool
- Tool calls are clearly marked with the function name and arguments
- You can then execute the function and send the result back to continue the conversation

**Handling Tool Call Results:**

```python
# After getting the tool call, execute the function
def get_weather(location, unit="celsius"):
    # Your actual weather API call here
    return f"The weather in {location} is 22°{unit[0].upper()} and sunny."

# Send tool result back to the model
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Beijing?"},
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": None,
        "tool_calls": [{
            "id": "call_123",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "get_weather",
                "arguments": '{"location": "Beijing", "unit": "celsius"}'
            }
        }]
    },
    {
        "role": "tool",
        "tool_call_id": "call_123",
        "content": get_weather("Beijing", "celsius")
    }
]

final_response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507",
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.7
)

print(final_response.choices[0].message.content)
# Output: "The current weather in Beijing is **22°C** and **sunny**. A perfect day to enjoy outdoor activities! 🌞"
```
