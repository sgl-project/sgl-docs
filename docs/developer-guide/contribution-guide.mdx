Welcome to **SGLang**! We appreciate your interest in contributing. This guide provides a concise overview of how to set up your environment, run tests, build documentation, and open a Pull Request (PR). Whether you're fixing a small bug or developing a major feature, we encourage following these steps for a smooth contribution process.

## Install SGLang from source

### Fork and clone the repository

<Note>
New contributors do **not** have write permission to push to the official SGLang repo. Fork the repository under your GitHub account, then clone your fork locally.
</Note>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_user_name>/sglang.git
```

### Build from source

Refer to [Install SGLang from source](/docs/get-started/installation).

## Format code with pre-commit

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to maintain consistent code style checks. Before pushing your changes, run:

```bash
pip3 install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

- **`pre-commit run --all-files`** manually runs all configured checks, applying fixes if possible. If it fails the first time, re-run it to ensure lint errors are fully resolved. Make sure your code passes all checks **before** creating a pull request.
- **Do not commit** directly to the `main` branch. Always create a new branch (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature`), push your changes, and open a PR from that branch.

## Run and add unit tests

If you add a new feature or fix a bug, add corresponding unit tests to ensure coverage and prevent regression. SGLang uses Python's built-in [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) framework. For detailed instructions on running tests and integrating them into CI, refer to [test/README.md](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/test/README.md).

## Write documentation

We recommend new contributors start from writing documentation, which helps you quickly understand the SGLang codebase. For more details, refer to [docs/README.md](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/docs/README.md).

## Test the accuracy

If your code changes the model output, run the accuracy tests. A quick sanity check is the few-shot GSM8K.

```bash
# Launch a server
python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct

# Evaluate
python3 -m sglang.test.few_shot_gsm8k --num-questions 200
```

<Warning>
This script is primarily a sanity check, not a rigorous accuracy or speed test. Results can vary by 1–5% due to batching and the non-deterministic nature of the inference engine. Do not rely on the "Latency/Output throughput" from this script as a proper speed benchmark.
</Warning>

GSM8K is too easy for state-of-the-art models. Try your own more challenging accuracy tests. Additional accuracy eval examples:

- [test_eval_accuracy_large.py](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/test/srt/test_eval_accuracy_large.py)
- [test_gpt_oss_1gpu.py](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/test/srt/test_gpt_oss_1gpu.py)

## Benchmark the speed

Refer to [Benchmark and Profiling](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docs/developer_guide/benchmark_and_profiling.md).

## Request a review for merge

Follow the pull request merge process described in [MAINTAINER.md](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/.github/MAINTAINER.md). You will need to work with the Merge Oncall, Codeowner, and other reviewers to get their approvals before your PR can be merged.

## How to trigger CI tests

We have many open PRs but limited CI machines, so only top and trusted contributors have permission to trigger CI tests. Users with permission are listed in [CI_PERMISSIONS.json](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/.github/CI_PERMISSIONS.json).

For CI to run on a pull request, it must have the `run-ci` label. Authorized users can add the label or rerun failed tests by commenting on the PR with one of these commands:

- `/tag-run-ci-label` — Adds the `run-ci` label. Every future commit will trigger CI.
- `/rerun-failed-ci` — Reruns the failed or flaky tests from the most recent commit.
- `/tag-and-rerun-ci` — Performs both `/tag-run-ci-label` and `/rerun-failed-ci`.
- `/rerun-stage <stage-name>` — Reruns a specific test stage without waiting for its dependencies. Useful when you want to quickly validate a fix for a specific failure instead of waiting ~30 minutes for preceding stages to complete.

If you have permission, the [Slash Command Handler](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/workflows/slash-command-handler.yml) will run your command and react with a 👍 to your comment. It may take a few minutes for the reaction to appear. See a usage [example](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/14253#issuecomment-3599509302).

To avoid spamming a PR with too many `/rerun-failed-ci` comments, trigger the command by editing an existing comment and adding any suffix (e.g., `/rerun-failed-ci try again`).

Example of rerunning a single test stage: `/rerun-stage unit-test-backend-4-gpu`.

If you don't have permission, ask a maintainer to trigger CI for you.

### CI rate limits

Due to CI scheduling and limited resources, higher-priority PRs may preempt running jobs. In such cases, you may need to rerun the tests.

We apply CI rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. Each CI workflow has a default limit defined in its workflow configuration file. For example, in [pr-gate.yml](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-gate.yml), the default cooldown period is 120 minutes:

```yaml
cool-down-minutes:
  description: "Default cooldown period in minutes; 0 disables rate limiting"
  type: number
  default: 120
```

Users listed in [CI_PERMISSIONS.json](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/.github/CI_PERMISSIONS.json) may have a per-user cooldown interval. In practice, the minimum of the workflow's default window and the user-specific interval is used.

## Code style guidance

- **Avoid code duplication.** If the same code snippet (more than five lines) appears multiple times, extract it into a shared function.
- **Minimize device synchronization.** Reduce expensive CPU-GPU synchronization operations such as `tensor.item()` or `tensor.cpu()` whenever possible. Use vectorized code.
- **Prioritize extreme efficiency.** SGLang is a runtime and most of your code runs on the critical path for every request. Optimize all minor overheads, especially in the model forward code.
  - A common pattern is runtime checks in the model forward pass ([e.g.](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/f1b0eda55c2c4838e8ab90a0fac7fb1e3d7064ab/python/sglang/srt/models/deepseek_v2.py#L486-L491)). These are very likely the same for every layer. Please cache the result as a single boolean value whenever possible.
- **Make functions as pure as possible.** Avoid in-place modification of arguments.
- **Keep files concise.** If a file exceeds 2,000 lines, split it into multiple smaller files (e.g., `scheduler.py`, `scheduler_output_processor_mixin.py`).
- **Keep tests fast.**
  - If a single test file runs longer than 500 seconds, split it into multiple smaller files (e.g., `test_eagle_infer_a.py`, `test_eagle_infer_b.py`).
  - If a single job in a GitHub workflow runs longer than 30 minutes, split it into smaller jobs or steps.
  - Reuse server launches in your unit tests to reduce runtime.
- **When supporting new hardware or features:**
  - Do not drastically change existing code.
  - Prefer new files to introduce specific components for your hardware (e.g., `allocator_ascend.py`).
  - If you write multiple if/else blocks for new features, ensure the common path (e.g., NVIDIA hardware or the existing code path) is the first branch.

## How to update sgl-kernel

Since sglang and sgl-kernel are separate Python packages, the GitHub CI infrastructure does not support updating a kernel and using it in the same pull request. To add or modify a kernel in sgl-kernel, use multiple PRs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit a kernel PR">
    Submit a PR to update the sgl-kernel source code without using it in the sglang Python package (e.g., [#8884](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/8884/files)).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bump the version">
    Bump the version of sgl-kernel (e.g., [#9220](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/9220/files)). Once merged, this triggers an automatic release of the sgl-kernel wheel to PyPI. If not urgent, you can wait. A new version is typically released within one week.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply the changes">
    Update the sgl-kernel version in `sglang/python/pyproject.toml` and update the related caller code in sglang to use the new kernel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for newcomers

If you want to contribute but don't have a specific idea, pick issues labeled [`good first issue` or `help wanted`](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22%2C%22help+wanted%22). These tasks have lower complexity and provide an excellent introduction to the codebase. Also check out this [code walk-through](https://github.com/zhaochenyang20/Awesome-ML-SYS-Tutorial/tree/main/sglang/code-walk-through) for a deeper look at SGLang's workflow.

If you have questions or want to start a discussion, ask in our [Slack channel](https://slack.sglang.io).

Thank you for your interest in SGLang. Happy coding!
