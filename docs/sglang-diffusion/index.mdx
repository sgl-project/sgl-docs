description: Score-based diffusion backbones in SGLang.

SGLang integrates score-based diffusion backbones that ship alongside the standard autoregressive suites, enabling structured text sampling workflows and high-performance diffusion model serving.

## Supported Models

Currently, SGLang supports a variety of diffusion-based language models. This section will be expanded as more models are validated and integrated into the core engine.

### Using Diffusion Models

To get started with diffusion models in SGLang, you can follow the same patterns as standard LLMs but with specific configuration for score-based generation.

```bash
python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path <path_to_diffusion_model>
```
